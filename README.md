## About Me  
I'm a data scientist passionate about using data and machine learning techniques to make an impact in helping solve critical problems.  

## Experience
### Data Science Intern at AFB International**
- Built classification algorithms and data pipelines to predict and optimize flavor preformance using ingredient ratios and trial metadata.
- Restructured trial processes to boost statistical power by blocking on key features correlating with historical flavor preferences.
- Used I-optimal trial selection to idenitfy which trials to prioritize for maximum Information Gain and reducing uncertainty in the model feedback loop.

**Software:** Python (Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib), SQL, Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, Powerpoint)

**Statistics & Machine Learning:** XGBoost/SHAP, RandomForest, Logistic/Linear Regression, K-Means Clustering, ANOVA/chi-square tests, Regularization, Dimension-Reduction (UMAP, PCA)
  
### Research Intern at UCLA Artificial Intelligence & Cultural Heritage Laboratory**
- Clustered questions from 15,000+ large-scale text documents into groups of semantic similarity, leveraging automated pronoun disambiguation.
- Built a hybrid pipeline composed of initial embedding screenings to filter out unlikley matches before passing the top options to a cross-attention based model with the relevant context window to maximize the quality of cluster assignments.
- Automated cluster quality evaluation by comparing the distance from each vector in a given cluster to the centroid of all vectors in the cluster, essentially reverse engineering the "cluster theme". This "cluster theme" was then given as a baseline metric for an LLM to numerically grade clustering compactness, providing contextual reasoning for its decisions.

**Software:** Python (PyTorch, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, NLTK, HuggingFace, SBERT), Linux

**Statistics & Machine Learning:** K-Means/HDBSCAN/DBSCAN CLustering, Logistic/Linear Regression, Large Language Models, Text-Embeddings, Dimension Reduction (UMAP/PCA), Silhouette Scores
